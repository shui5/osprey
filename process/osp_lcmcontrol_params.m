% This function creates the basic struct for the creation of the LCModel control
% file. You need to fill in all the needed information below to make this
% work. For more information and parameter please refer to the LCModel
% manual. Remember to create the output folder on your Linux machine,
% otherwise the analysis will fail. You need to adapt all path variables.
%   OUTPUT:     Creates control file for LCmodel analysis
